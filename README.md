# Robotics Project

Welcome to the Robotics Project repository! This project contains the code and documentation for a series of robotics applications and experiments.

## Introduction

This repository houses various robotics projects that demonstrate the capabilities of autonomous systems and robotics algorithms. The code for this project is designed to run on mini computers like the Raspberry Pi and microcontrollers such as the RP2040, programmed using the Arduino IDE.

**Deploying on hardware:**

    - Ensure all hardware is connected and powered on.
    - Upload the Arduino code to the RP2040 using the Arduino IDE.
